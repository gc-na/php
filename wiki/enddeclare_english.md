# Understanding the `enddeclare` Command in PHP: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `enddeclare` command in PHP is used to close a block of code that was opened with the `declare` construct. It is essential for managing the scope and behavior of code execution within specific contexts, particularly for optimizing performance and error handling.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `declare` statement in PHP allows developers to set execution directives for a block of code. This includes options like enabling strict types, setting error reporting levels, or defining performance-related settings. The `enddeclare` command signifies the end of this block, ensuring that the directives apply only to the enclosed code.

### Usage
The `declare` construct has the following syntax:

```php
declare (directive => value) {
    // Code block
}
```

Once the block is defined, the `enddeclare` command is used to close it:

```php
declare (directive => value) {
    // Code block
} enddeclare;
```

### Details
- **Directives**: Common directives include `ticks`, which triggers a function on every Nth tick, and `strict_types`, which enforces strict type checking.
- **Scope**: The code within the `declare` block is affected by the specified directive until the `enddeclare` is reached.
- **Error Handling**: Using `declare` with error reporting directives allows for better control over how errors are managed in specific segments of your code.

## Examples
### Basic Usage Example
```php
declare (ticks=1) {
    echo "This will execute on each tick.";
}

enddeclare;
```

### Example with Strict Types
```php
declare(strict_types=1);
function addNumbers(int $a, int $b): int {
    return $a + $b;
} 
enddeclare;

// Calling the function with strict types enforced
$result = addNumbers(5, 10); // Valid
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Misplacement**: Ensure that `enddeclare` is correctly placed; otherwise, PHP will throw a syntax error.
2. **Unsupported Directives**: Not all PHP versions support every directive within `declare`. Check compatibility based on your PHP version.
3. **Not Using Ticks**: When using `ticks`, ensure that a function is defined to handle the ticks; otherwise, no action will occur.

### Additional Notes
- The `declare` statement can only be used for specific directives and not all PHP features.
- It is often considered a performance optimization feature, especially in larger applications where execution contexts are critical.

## One Line Summary
The `enddeclare` command in PHP is used to close a block of code initiated by the `declare` statement, controlling the execution context for specific directives.
