# Understanding the `global` Keyword in PHP: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `global` keyword in PHP is used to access global variables from within functions or methods, allowing developers to manipulate data that resides outside of their local scope.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `global` keyword enables functions or methods to reference global variables, which are defined outside their local scope. This is particularly useful when you need to maintain state or share data across different parts of your application without passing variables as parameters.

### Usage
To use the `global` keyword, you declare it within a function followed by the variable name. This tells PHP to look for that variable in the global scope instead of the local function scope.

### Syntax
```php
global $variableName;
```

### Details
- The `global` keyword can be used with any variable that is defined outside of a function.
- If you attempt to access a global variable without the `global` keyword, PHP will treat it as a local variable, which may lead to undefined variable errors.
- You can also use the `GLOBALS` array to access global variables, which is an associative array containing all global variables.

## Examples
### Basic Example
```php
$globalVar = "I am a global variable";

function testGlobal() {
    global $globalVar;
    echo $globalVar; // Outputs: I am a global variable
}

testGlobal();
```

### Using `GLOBALS` Array
```php
$anotherGlobalVar = "Accessing via GLOBALS";

function accessGlobals() {
    echo $GLOBALS['anotherGlobalVar']; // Outputs: Accessing via GLOBALS
}

accessGlobals();
```

## Explanation
While using the `global` keyword is straightforward, there are some common pitfalls to watch out for:

1. **Variable Scoping**: Make sure the global variable is defined before the function is called. If not, it will result in an undefined variable error.
   
2. **Overwriting Variables**: If you use `global` to modify a variable, the change will affect the global variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully.

3. **Readability**: Excessive use of global variables can make code less readable and harder to maintain. Itâ€™s generally recommended to limit their use and consider alternative approaches, such as dependency injection.

4. **Performance**: Accessing global variables can be slightly slower than local variables due to the additional lookup required, although the difference is usually negligible.

## One Line Summary
The `global` keyword in PHP allows functions to access and manipulate global variables defined outside their local scope, facilitating shared data management.
