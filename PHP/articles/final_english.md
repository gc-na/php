# Understanding the "final" Keyword in PHP: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `final` keyword in PHP is used to prevent class inheritance and method overriding, ensuring that a class or method cannot be altered by extending classes. This feature enhances encapsulation and design integrity in object-oriented programming.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `final` keyword is primarily utilized in object-oriented programming (OOP) within PHP to restrict the extension of classes and the overriding of methods. By declaring a class or method as `final`, developers can safeguard their implementations from being modified in subclasses, promoting the intended behavior and structure of the code.

### Usage
- **Final Classes**: When a class is declared as `final`, it cannot be inherited by any other class.
- **Final Methods**: When a method is declared as `final`, it cannot be overridden in any subclasses.

### Syntax
```php
final class ClassName {
    // Class properties and methods
}

class ParentClass {
    final public function methodName() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Final Class
```php
final class BaseClass {
    public function display() {
        return "This is a final class.";
    }
}

// Attempting to extend a final class will result in an error
class DerivedClass extends BaseClass { // Error: Cannot inherit from final class
}
```

### Example 2: Final Method
```php
class BaseClass {
    final public function finalMethod() {
        return "This method cannot be overridden.";
    }
}

class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {
    public function finalMethod() { // Error: Cannot override final method
        return "Attempting to override a final method.";
    }
}
```

## Explanation
When using the `final` keyword, developers should be aware of the following common pitfalls:

1. **Inheritance Restrictions**: Declaring a class as `final` means that no other classes can extend it. This can limit flexibility in code design, so use the `final` keyword judiciously.
   
2. **Method Overriding**: Declaring a method as `final` can be a double-edged sword. While it prevents changes in subclasses, it may also hinder the ability to extend functionality. It's essential to evaluate whether a method truly needs to be final.

3. **Compatibility**: Using `final` can make future modifications to the codebase more challenging, especially if a developer later determines that inheritance or overriding would be beneficial.

## One Line Summary
The `final` keyword in PHP is used to declare classes and methods that cannot be inherited or overridden, ensuring design integrity and encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
