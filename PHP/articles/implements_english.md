# Understanding "implements" in PHP: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `implements` keyword in PHP is used to define that a class implements an interface, allowing for a contract that specifies methods a class must define, enabling polymorphism and enhancing code maintainability.

## Documentation
In PHP, an interface is a blueprint for classes. When a class implements an interface, it agrees to implement all of the methods defined in that interface. This is crucial for achieving abstraction and ensuring that classes adhere to a specific contract.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of using `implements` is to create a contract that ensures consistency across different classes implementing the same interface. This allows for more flexible and maintainable code, as different classes can be used interchangeably as long as they implement the same interface.

### Usage
To use the `implements` keyword, follow these steps:

1. **Define an Interface**: Use the `interface` keyword to create an interface with method signatures that need to be implemented.
2. **Implement the Interface**: Use the `implements` keyword in the class definition to signify that the class will provide concrete implementations for the methods defined in the interface.

### Syntax
```php
interface InterfaceName {
    public function methodName();
}

class ClassName implements InterfaceName {
    public function methodName() {
        // implementation code
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `implements` keyword:

```php
interface Animal {
    public function makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Meow";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
echo $dog->makeSound(); // Outputs: Bark

$cat = new Cat();
echo $cat->makeSound(); // Outputs: Meow
```

### Multiple Interfaces Implementation
A class can implement multiple interfaces, providing a way to inherit behaviors from multiple sources:

```php
interface Walkable {
    public function walk();
}

interface Speakable {
    public function speak();
}

class Human implements Walkable, Speakable {
    public function walk() {
        return "Walking";
    }

    public function speak() {
        return "Speaking";
    }
}

$human = new Human();
echo $human->walk(); // Outputs: Walking
echo $human->speak(); // Outputs: Speaking
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Not Implementing All Methods**: If a class claims to implement an interface but does not implement all of its methods, PHP will throw a fatal error.
2. **Method Visibility**: The methods in the implementing class must be declared as `public`. Declaring them as `protected` or `private` will lead to an error.
3. **Interface Inheritance**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces. If an interface extends another, the implementing class must implement all methods from both interfaces.

### Gotchas
- **Type Hinting**: Interfaces can be used as type hints in function parameters or return types, allowing for more flexible code.
- **Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces**: Understand the distinction; abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces can only declare methods without implementation.

## One Line Summary
The `implements` keyword in PHP allows a class to adhere to a contract defined by an interface, ensuring method implementation and promoting code consistency.
